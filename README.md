Unit Testing Project

This project is designed to demonstrate unit testing in C# using Visual Studio. The application includes a set of unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the underlying logic and functionalities.

How to Execute the Unit Testing Project

1. Environment Needed / Requirements

To run the unit testing project, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

Microsoft Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise editions)

.NET Framework or .NET Core SDK (version compatible with the project)

MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit packages installed (depending on the testing framework used)

2 GB of RAM (minimum requirement)

Windows 10 or above

2. Opening the Project

Follow these steps to open and execute the project in Visual Studio:

Locate the solution file:

Open the project folder and find the .sln file (e.g., UnitTestingProject.sln).

Open the solution:

Double-click the .sln file to open it in Visual Studio.

Build the solution:

Click Build > Build Solution or press Ctrl + Shift + B to ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved.

3. Running the Unit Tests

Open the Test Explorer:

In Visual Studio, navigate to Test > Test Explorer to display the Test Explorer window.

Run all tests:

Click the Run All button in the Test Explorer to execute all available unit tests.

Review results:

The Test Explorer will display the results of the test runs, indicating which tests passed, failed, or were skipped.

4. Adding New Tests

To add new tests to the project:

Create a test class:

Add a new class to the Tests folder (e.g., NewFeatureTests.cs).

Use the appropriate testing framework:

Annotate methods with attributes like [TestMethod] (MSTest), [Fact] (xUnit), or [Test] (NUnit).

Write test methods:

Ensure each test method includes appropriate assertions to validate expected outcomes.

Rebuild and rerun tests:

Save the changes, rebuild the solution, and run the tests again to validate your new test cases.

Notes

Ensure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date before running the tests.

Use the NuGet Package Manager to install additional testing libraries if needed.

Review test coverage and consider edge cases to ensure comprehensive testing.
